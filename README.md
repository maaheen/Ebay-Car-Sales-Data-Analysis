# Ebay-Car-Sales-Data-Analysis

In this project, I'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

The conclusion was the range of car mileages does not vary as much as the prices do by brand, instead all falling within 10% for the top brands. There is a slight trend to the more expensive vehicles having higher mileage, with the less expensive vehicles having lower mileage.
